# Answering Question Game

## Description
The Answering Question Game is a C# console application that
challenges players with questions by hitting a little question mark icon.
The player must correctly answer as many questions as they can under 30 seconds. 
If they answer correctly they can gain points. To win the game they must be able to answer at least 5 questions. 

## Purpose
This project was created during our first semester at John Abbott College as part of the Computer Science program.
It was our first experience coding in C# and for our final project, we had to come up with a simple game idea that applied the concepts we had learned. 
The project reflects beginner-level coding skills and demonstrates an introduction to programming. 

## Features
- Real-time score tracking
- Built using C#
